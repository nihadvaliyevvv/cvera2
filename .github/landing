Design and develop a cutting-edge, visually immersive, and 3D-oriented landing page for an online resume builder or personal portfolio platform.

🔵 General Theme:
Futuristic, clean, and elegant. The experience should evoke trust and creativity, combining professional UX with artistic and technical depth. Use scroll-based transitions and a cinematic intro to grab user attention immediately.

👁️‍🗨️ Visual Direction:
- 3D visuals with depth and parallax (WebGL/Three.js or animated SVG layers)
- Glassmorphism, soft gradients, neon accents, and smooth hover/mouse interactions
- Modular and responsive layout with scroll-triggered animations (GSAP or Framer Motion)
- Dark/light toggle with animated transition
- Floating/responsive 3D objects (resumes, laptops, documents)
- Animated cursor (magnetic or trail-follow effect)

📄 Section Breakdown (Resume Builder / CV-focused site):

1. **Hero Section:**
   - Animated tagline: “Design your future resume in 3D.”
   - 3D visual of a resume floating, flipping, or being typed in real-time.
   - CTA buttons: “Build Your Resume” / “See Templates” (with hover-glow effects)
   - Background: subtle motion particles or interactive depth field

2. **How It Works Section:**
   - 3-step process: Choose Template → Customize → Export
   - Each step shown with animated 3D icon (e.g., document flying into editor)
   - Timeline-style scroll reveal

3. **Interactive Resume Demo:**
   - Embedded interactive resume preview with real-time 3D flip or scroll
   - Hover over sections to animate skills, experience, etc.

4. **Templates Gallery:**
   - Grid or carousel of 3D template thumbnails
   - On-hover animations (zoom, rotate, glass reflection)
   - Filter system (modern, minimalist, creative, corporate)

5. **AI-Powered Features Section:**
   - Show icons for “AI Text Generator”, “Skill Suggestions”, “Grammar Check”, etc.
   - Animate with Lottie or SVGs with glowing neon borders

6. **User Testimonials:**
   - Floating card-style reviews with scrolling marquee or 3D slide-in effect
