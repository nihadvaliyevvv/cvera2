Prompt for AI (like Claude)
Objective: Generate the complete HTML and CSS code for a professional, single-page landing website for a company called "CVERA". The design, layout, structure, and all visual elements must be an exact replica of the provided image (Design.jpg), with one critical modification: the primary color scheme must be changed from teal/green to a professional blue.

Key Design Mandates (to be replicated exactly from the image):

Color Palette (CRITICAL CHANGE):

Primary Background: White (#FFFFFF).

Dark Section/Footer Background: Very dark navy blue (#161C2D).

Primary Accent Color: A professional, vibrant blue (e.g., #3B82F6 or a similar tech blue) to replace all instances of teal/green. This applies to buttons, icons, highlights, underlines, and gradients.

Secondary Accent Color: A very light, pale blue (e.g., #EFF6FF) to replace the light minty green backgrounds and gradient elements.

Text Colors: Dark navy blue/black on light backgrounds, white on dark backgrounds. Gray for secondary text.

Typography:

Use a clean, modern sans-serif font (like "Manrope" or "Inter").

Strictly follow the typographic hierarchy shown in the image: large bold headlines, smaller subheadings, and regular-weight body text.

Layout & Structure:

Replicate the layout perfectly, including all spacing, card designs, soft shadows on elements, and section structure.

Maintain the use of custom icons and stylized illustrations, adapting their content for a CV builder theme.
