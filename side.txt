You are designing the main layout for the CV editing page of the CVera platform.

The layout should support editable CV sections, dynamic forms, a live A4 preview, and space for side advertisements. The page structure must be clean, modern, and responsive.

### 🎯 Layout Goal

Visual Structure of the Page:


---

### 🧱 Layout Description:

#### 🔹 Horizontal Split Layout
- The top part of the page should be split into **two columns**:
  1. **Sidebar – Section List (Left column)**
     - Vertical list of CV sections (Personal Info, Education, Experience, etc.)
     - Acts as navigation between form sections
     - Width: ~250–300px

  2. **Edit Form Panel (Right column)**
     - Displays the form related to the selected section
     - Scrollable vertically if needed
     - Width: remaining space after sidebar and ads

- **Both columns must be centered**, with **side space on left and right for ads**

#### 🔹 Vertical Layout Below – A4 Preview Section
- Below the two-column layout, there must be a **third section spanning full width**:
  - Fixed dimensions of A4: `794px x 1123px` (in pixels)
  - Should reflect live CV data updates
  - Internally scrollable if content overflows
  - Should look exactly like the final PDF export (layout, fonts, spacing)

---

### 📐 Side Advertisement Space

- Allocate thin vertical spaces on both left and right edges of the screen for ads
- Width: ~60–80px each
- Sticky/fixed so ads remain visible when scrolling
- Should not interfere with the main layout (avoid overlapping)

---

### 🧾 Technical Implementation Notes:

- Use `flexbox` or CSS grid for the main structure:
```html
<div class="page-container flex">
  <aside class="ad-left">[Ad]</aside>

  <div class="main-content flex flex-col">
    <div class="editor-section flex">
      <div class="section-list">[Sections]</div>
      <div class="edit-form">[Form]</div>
    </div>

    <div class="preview-section">[A4 Live Preview]</div>
  </div>

  <aside class="ad-right">[Ad]</aside>
</div>
````
